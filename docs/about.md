# Sea

Sea - AngularJS REST/ORM framework

Sea is an AngularJS framework to manage resources served by a REST service.
It is also an ORM where you can define models and their relationships with other models.

Sea provides an easy way to define models and to interact with them.
You can retrieve, create, update and delete resources in a clean and fast way.

Sea has two aims:

- A conventional client-side ORM tries to abstract the access to the database.
It manages the database connections and builds the sql commands to query the data.
The same idea was thought to Sea, but insted to abstract the database access
and the sql commannds, Sea abstracs a REST service and the Ajax calls.

- A conventional ORM also manages the model's relationships. Sea also tries managing
the model's relationships, connecting the instances, and loading the data automatically.
